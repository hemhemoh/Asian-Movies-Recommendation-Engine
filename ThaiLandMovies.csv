Frustrated with having to keep their relationship hidden, Sua and Jib decide to get married. However, neither are willing to resign from their jobs. One day, a software error in one of the bank's ATMs in Chonburi causes it to malfunction, causing it to double the money it dispenses. Through two poor men, Pued (Thawat Pornrattanaprasert) and Paed (Chalermpol Tikumporntheerawong), word spreads quickly and the ATM draws a large crowd of ecstatic football spectators. ฿130,000 is withdrawn before the machine is shut down. Jib and Sua make a bet that whoever recovers the money withdrawn from the ATM can remain employed, while the other must resign. Both go to extreme lengths to win. Jib tries to recover the money from the ones that withdrew through reasoning, while Sua uses more unorthodox strategies. Pued used his ATM withdrawal to buy a motorcycle, while Paed used it to buy a golden tooth as well as a truck. Sua soon teams up with them in his attempt to recover the withdrawn money, unaware that they are two of the people who received double cash from the faulty ATM. Meanwhile, Jib finds that one of the people who benefited from the ATM, Madam Aummara (Puttachart Pongsuchart), had used the money to buy new machines for her laundry shop. Madam Aummara refuses to tell Jib anything. Later Sua meets Aummara's daughter, Gob (Sananthachat Thanapatpisal), who soon falls in love with him. Sua is unaware that she is actually Pued's girlfriend, and Pued is heartbroken when he learns of Gob's new infatuation. Both Sua and Jib learn that Pued and Paed were two of the people that withdrew cash from the malfunctioning ATM, and convince them to confess. They also discover that the branch manager Pakorn Kulariboriboon (Pongkool Suebsung) had also withdrawn from the ATM, and force him to confess as well. Sua learns that one of the people who withdrew from the ATM is Sergeant Sam (Anna Chuancheun), the same police officer who confronted him when his company car was towed, and also the owner of a crocodile that had previously chased Sua from a farm. After Sua buys a police costume and fake guns to attack Sam, he is jailed for posing as a policeman. After his release from jail, Sua warns Jib about Sergeant Sam, but Jib assumes that Sua is tricking her. Sua then rides Paed's truck with Pued, Aummara, and Gob (who finds out that he is a relationship with Jib) to save Jib, who has been cornered by the crocodile and Sam. The ensuing fight leads to the accidental shooting of Jack, the crocodile. Jack is rushed to the hospital. When they find news of the atrocious medical expenses for Jack's recovery, Jib decides to pay for them. Pued and Gob reconcile also. Because Pued, Paed, Aummara, Gob, and Sam have both used the money that they've withdrawn, Sua and Jib realize they cannot recover the money. Later, Sua returns ฿130,000 of his own money to the bank manager, money intended for his marriage with Jib. Jib, who has had to resign her job due to her relationship being discovered by Yeoh (Gornpop Janjaroen), is displeased by this, so she and Sua break off the relationship and cancel the wedding. Then on October 31, Halloween, the date they were supposed to get married, Sua and Jib, after a brief skirmish, reconcile and kiss in the end.","{'', 'Pongsatorn Jongwilas\nSupport Role', 'Ud Awat Ratanapintha\nGuest Role', 'Support Role', 'Mez Tharatorn\nUnknown Role', 'Thanapatpisal Sananthachat\nSupport Role', 'Tikumpornteerawong Chaleumpol\nSupport Role', 'Charoensook Paopetch\nGuest Role', 'Pornrattanaprasert Thawat\nSupport Role', 'Joke Gornpop Janjaroen\nSupport Role', 'Pongthananikorn Preechaya\nMain Role', 'Dhanasevi Chantavit\nMain Role', 'Chicha Amatayakul\nSupport Role'}",Thailand

The wife was so disgusted that she destroyed them all. This enraged the ancient spirits and they placed a curse on her. At that time, she was pregnant with her twin daughters. So the curse was transferred to one of them, leading her to be the next Gorgon's descendant. She eventually gave birth to Ornchuma and Inthira. While Ornchuma behaved normally, Inthira (the Gorgon) kept saying abnormal stuffs about the snake and acting suspicously. The mom was so fed up with her that she divorced the father and took Ornchuma with her. Inthira, on the other hand, was kicked out of the house with her father. Fast forward to the present, Inthira has come back after her dad passed away. While Ornchuma and her brother Itsara welcome their younger sister, Inthira is planning a revenge on her mother. Little do they know that Inthira possesses a supernatural power which can turn human being into stone (dead). Kingkawin is a supermarket thief. One day, when he is due to meet Ornchuma, he mistakens Inthira as her. Inthira wants her sister and brother to love her and only her, so she is very jealous of Kingkawin and plans to pretend to be Ornchuma to lure him to the house and kill him. Realizing that he may have gone missing, Korrapin goes looking for her brother. Korrapin is a young girl that studies dharma and religious stuff at the local church. She is destined to be the one to stop Gorgon's doings. While looking for Kingkawin, she always bumps into Itsara and eventually the two fall in love. Feeling the beloved brother no longer cares for her, Inthira tries to kill Korrapin. To keep her safe, Itsara calls the help of Wasin, who is in love with Ornchuma.
