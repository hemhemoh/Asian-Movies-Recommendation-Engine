RecAsian

RecAsian is a movie recommendation engine for Asian drama lovers. Due to the nature of how some of the asian movie websites are built, the advanced version of ths project will be the go-to guy for any asian drama lover.

Asian drama lovers do not joke with recommended movies but feel frustrated everytime they dont get the right recommendations or what they expected is not what they got and things like that.

The RecAsian is going to be a web application where people input the name of the mpves they have watched or the actors who featured in the movie and get another similar movie recommended.

Here's what I have done so far:
 * Scraped the web for data.
 * Data cleaning and preprocessing.
 * Built a content collaborative recommendation engine
 
 Due to the unavailability of computing power on my end, I couldn't do as much as I would love to but here are other ways you can contribute to this project.
 * More data from other asian movie websites.
 * Other types of recommendation engine.
 
 Please note that, you can contribute in other ways too, just make sure to raise an issue before opening a pull request.
 
 # Tech skills required
