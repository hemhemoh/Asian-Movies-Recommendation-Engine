They were said to be the best fighters in southern China at the time. The Ten Tigers were Thit Kew Sam, Wong Yein Lam, Wong Khei Yin, Su Hak Fu, Su Hut Yee, Chow Thye, Tham Chai Wen, Wong Cheng Ho, Tit Chee Chan, and See Yu Leong. Thit Kew Sam was the foremost of the Ten Guangdong Tigers. Thit Kew Sam, which literally means ""Iron Bridge Three"", was his nickname because his arms were very powerful; his actual name was Leong Khuen. His internal force came mainly from his training of Thit Seen Khuen, or Iron Wire Set. Wong Yein Lam was a master of Hap Ka (Family of Knights) Kungfu. Hap Ka Kungfu originated from Lama Kungfu of Tibet, but had been modified and taught by Shaolin monks or lay masters. Wong Yein Lam's teacher was a Shaolin monk called Sheng Loong. Wong Khei Yin was a disciple of Luk Ah Choy and the father of Wong Fei Hoong. His was well known for his ""no-shadow kicks"". Su Hak Fu was a master of the Black Tiger Style. He was good at the tiger-claw. ""Hak Fu"" actually means ""Black Tiger""; it is uncertain whether it was his real name or nickname. Su Hut Yee, which means Beggar Su, was originally rich but squandered away his money. He was a master of Hoong Ka Kungfu. He learned from Chan Fook, a monk from the southern Shaolin Monastery, and was probably the same Chan Fook who started my lineage from Uncle Righteousness. Chow Thye was well known for his staff, known as Tai Cho Chooi Wan Khun, or ""Soul-Chasing Staff of the First Emperor"". He shot to fame when he defeated an international boxing champion from France. Tham Chai Wen was known as ""Three-Leg Tham"" because of his three kicking techniques. They were tiger-tail kick, weeping-floor kick, and organ-seeking kick. Wong Cheng Ho was famous for his Iron Head. He learned his kungfu in a Guangdong temple from a monk belonging to the Shaolin tradition. Tit Chee Chan means ""Iron Finger Chan""; his real name was unknown. Naturally, he was expert at the Iron Finger Art. See Yu Leong was known for the Red Sand Palm. This is an advanced Shaolin art using internal force which leaves a red mark on the skin of an opponent after being struck.","{'', 'Yiu Claire\nSupport Role', 'Chapman To\nSupport Role', 'Keung Philip\nMain Role', 'Eddy Ko\nMain Role', 'Yu Rong Guang\nSupport Role', 'Huang Michael\nMain Role', 'Annie Man\nSupport Role', 'Stephen Au\nMain Role', 'Ng Berg\nMain Role', 'Ricky Chan\nSupport Role', 'Chan Alice\nSupport Role', 'Support Role'}",Chinese

Instead of solving cases where there is a dead body, cases of kidnapping or missing items, mysteries are to be solved in this show. There will be a detective, a keyman (who can lie) and the rest are players, there might be some episodes where there is no detective so they will not have first round of voting. The sets for the keyman are very realistic as they are built for each episode and the cast goes through the story themselves. The props are very real and fitting for the set designs. In this aspect, it is very similar to the Who's The Murderer: Season 3 where the hotel of the first episode was built just for the show. This show goes through the same format as 'Who's the murderer'; The case will start off like a story until some incident happens. All players will tell their alibis for their timelines. They will be split into groups to search for proof and evidence for 10 minutes. They will then head to the discussion room and explain or ask questions on the evidence that they have found. The detective will then make his/her first decision on who is the keyman. The show will carry on with all players finding evidence together and discovering more of the story as time passes. The detective will then have a one-on-one interrogation and sometimes will ask the players on who they suspect is the keyman. The search will carry on for a little while more before they do a group meeting on settling the final facts they know. The players are given time to have solo searches for additional evidence that they might have missed on before heading to make their decision on who the keyman is. The votes of all players are calculated and the player with most votes will be chosen as the keyman. The chosen player will then insert their key into the machine that reveals if they are indeed the keyman. If the machine lights up and turns on, the players have won and found the keyman. If the machine does not turn on, they have failed in finding the real keyman and he/she gets away with it.
